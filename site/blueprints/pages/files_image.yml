              Images don’t need to be provided in a specific format or size, but a standard could be:
              
              **Jpg** for photography and other motifs with a lot of color or noise.
              • Around 3000 px on the short side
              • Rgb, 72 dpi, can be compressed with 80%
              • File size between 1MB and 6MB
              Export from Photoshop via File → Export → Save for web 

              **Png** for graphics and other motifs with a limited range of colors.
              **Svg** just like PNGs, when originating from a vector drawing.
              Export from Illustrator via File → Export for Screens

              **Gif** for animated video sequences. If a Gif represents a video file, then it should be uploaded directly to the video entity.

              **Panorama** images will be cropped to 4096 x 2048 pixels
