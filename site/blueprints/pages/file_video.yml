                      Kirby cannot see the contents of the remote file host. So the above fields have to be correct. Additionally, all files uploaded to DO have to be public.

              **File naming convention:**
              `{filename}-{height-in-pixels}.mp4`
              e.g.: `my-video-720.mp4`

              Include the `.mp4` in the name of this archive entity.

              To make a video accessible for many devices, it should be availible in 4 quality version:
              • MP4 1080p: 1920 x 1080
              • MP4 720p: 1280 x 720 (most important)
              • MP4 480p: 854 x 480
              • MP4 360p: 640 x 360

              CDA owns a dedicated Digital Ovean Spaces file hosting service. Upload videos in the following pattern:
              `cda/archive/videos/{filename}/{filename}-{size}.mp4`

              **Thumbnails**
              Thumbnails should have the same aspect ratio as the original video (e.g. 16:9), but can have best quality.
