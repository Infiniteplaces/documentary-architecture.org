## Stack
- PHP 7
- [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/tour) CMS
- HTML, (S)CSS, JS

And partially

- JSON API
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) JS Framework

## Dev setup
Clone this repo including all submodules to your disk and cd into the project.
```
git clone --recursive {giturl}
```

**1. PHP 7**
To run the website you need PHP 7 installed.
Run [locally:8000](http://localhost:8000/) with
```
php -S localhost:8000 kirby/router.php
```

**2. SCSS**
All style definitions are made within `assets/scss/...` and are compiled to CSS in `assets/css` upon save.
For VS Code, I use [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) which auto includes all needed css prefixes. Make sure to also compile a sourcemap.
Settings in VS Code `settings.json`:
```json
{
    ...
    "liveSassCompile.settings.formats":[
        {
            "format": "expanded",
            "extensionName": ".css",
            "savePath": "~/../css"
        },
        {
            "format": "compressed",
            "extensionName": ".min.css",
            "savePath": "~/../css"
        }
    ],
    "liveSassCompile.settings.excludeList": [ 
        "kirby/**",
        "site/**" 
    ]
}
```

**3. Svelte**
Some frontent pages are delivered blank by Kirby and are filled with Svelte, using data from the API. Svelte is a JS framework like react, but instead of having its own runtime, it is complied to vanilla JS before being shipped to the browser. The whole Svelte thing lives in a Kirby Plugin at `site/plugins/framework`. `cd` over there and run
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
However, you donâ€™t have to do the Svelte thing to work on the rest of the site.
