      section_kirby:
        type: info
        headline: Working with Kirby
        text: |
          **Entity Status**
          All entities in Kirby can have 3 statuses:
          üå∫ `draft`: not visible, cannot be linked to other entities.
          üåö `unlisted`: only visible with a direct URL.
          üå≥ `listed`: published on the website.
          All newly created entities are unlisted, indicated by the blue-grey dot.

          **Titles, URLs, Signatures**
          Besides a title `Max Liebling House`, all entities have a URL `max-liebling-house`. The URL remains the same when renaming an Entity and you would have to manually do it. But be careful, this coul lead to possible broken links.

          **Languages**
          All content should be provided in `english`, but can optionally be translated to `german`.

          **Unsaved and locked pages**
          When you edit an entity, a orange bar at the bottom of the page appears that reminds you to save your work. As lang as you edit a page, it is locked for other users.

          **Errors or something feels strange**
          Reloading the page often helps :) Or post it on Slack, if that doesn‚Äôt help.

      section_dates:

        headline: Language, Naming and Formatting
        text: |
          There are a lot of terms, to which apply formatting rules to make information more coherent and to simplify the way it can be found, queried and interlinked.

          **Language**
          Use british english. Some basic information, including titles, can be translated to German.
      
          **Peoples‚Äô names**
          Firstname Familyname

          **Dates**
          Day:    `YYYY-MM-DD`
          Month:  `YYYY-MM`
          Year:   `YYYY`

          Years:  `YYYY-YYYY`
          Decade: `YYY0s`
          Decades: `YYY0s-YYY0s`
          
          **Filenames**
          {date}-{title-or-name}-{category-or-specification-or-number}.{ext}
          Filenames should not be very long, ond only consist of `a-z` `0-9` `-`.

          **Cities, Countries**
          Whenever possible, use the english name of a city or country. To undoubtly specify a country, use `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2` language codes.

      section_kirbytags:
        type: info
        headline: Tags
        text: |
          In every textbox, Tags can be used additionally to Markdown, to insert special features inside the text.

          **Linked keyword**
          `(-keyword: Key Word)`

          **Linked date**
          `(-date: 1990s)`
          `(-date: 1999)`
          `(-date: 1999-12-31)`

          **Link external website in new tab**
          `(-link: https://wikipedia.org)`
          `(-link: https://wikipedia.org text: Wiki)`

          **Link entity using signature**
          `(-link: path/entity-slug-or-filename)`
          `(-link: path/entity-slug-or-filename text: Titel)`

          The link text will be auto generated or can be specified using the `text:` attribute.

          **Insert image into text:**
          `(-image: archive/images/filename.jpg)`

          If you want to just link to the image instead of actually inserting it, use the `(link: )` tag above.

          **Linked source**
          `(-source: archive/sources/...)`
          *This works so far, but is planned to be extended with further functionality.* 

          **Linked location**
          `(-location: Location Title)`
          The location tag can have many optional attributes like
          `street`, `city`, `zip`, `country`, `lat`, `lon`, e.g:
          `(-location: Tel Aviv country: IL)`
          `(-location: Hidden Treasure lat: 32,83 lon: 12,87)`
          See above for country codes.

          ‚ö†Ô∏èThe dashes after the first bracket (`-`link: ) must be removed in order for the magic to happen, like `(link: ...`
          
      section_markdown:
        type: info
        headline: Markdown
        text: |
          In every textbox, Markdown syntax can be used to format text. Since the overall design of the website content shall not be controlled with crazy markdown usage, it is recommend to only use a limited range of features. Some of them are:

          **Italic:** `*asterisks*`

          (To be extended when needed.)
